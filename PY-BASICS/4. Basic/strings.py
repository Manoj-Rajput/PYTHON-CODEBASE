               Python is a language that depends on interpretation of indentation,
               So using Tab character is not acceptable, 
               
               Hence, go to you editor's settings, set preferred language to Python,
                    Replace the Tab with 4 Spaces.
                    Also set your editor to view Tabs & white spaces to draw out any potential of errors for copied code.
               This setting will take care of indentation errors.
